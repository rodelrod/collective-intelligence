collective-intelligence
=======================

Running through the examples in *Segaran T., "Programming Collective Intelligence", 1st edition*.

I'm taking a TDD approach, building tests with the results presented in the book and building my own code. This means the code is often different from the one in the text.
Some of the differences:
 - Bugs in the original code are fixed
 - Used descriptive variable names
 - Respects PEP 8 style 
 - More idiomatic Python
 - Some of the of the code is clearer and/or better perfoming
